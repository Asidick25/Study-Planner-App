# Project Overview

## Project Introduction
This project is a user-friendly web-based application that is designed to help NCH Apprentices organise their yearly schedules effectively. The app allows the users to upload their timetables provided to them in the induction, visualise all the deadlines on an interactive calendar, and manage their time effectively. With an interactive, accessible and modern design, the study planner app aims to enhance the productivity of apprentices and reduce the stress associated in planning multiple deadlines. 

Key features include:
- Timetable upload feature where users can upload their timetables as a `.csv` or `.xlsx` file.
- An interactive monthly calendar that displays all the tasks and deadlines.
- Task Addition Feature to add new tasks directly into the calendars.
- Naviagtion for viewing deadlines across various months and years.

The app will allow students to balance their apprenticeship requirements and assignments together with work and personal commitments.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements 
1. User Interface (UI)
   - Timetable Upload:
     Users should have an input field to be able to upload their timetable files as CSV or XLSX.
   - File Validation:
     Users receive information about the invalid file types during the upload.
   - Calendar Display:
     A calendar view should be displayed with the tasks and their corresponding deadlines.
   - Task Management:
     The ability for the users to add, edit or delete tasks from the calendar using the 'SAVE' or 'CANCEL' buttons.
   - Monthly Navigation:
     Users have the ability to navigate between months using the 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons at the top of the calendar.

2. Timetable Data
   - File Processing:
     Retrival of information like the deadlines and dates from the uploaded timetables.
   - Dynamic Updates:
     Users are able to update the tasks without refreshing the page.

3. Validation
   - File Validation:
     Ensure the uploaded files have a specific format and columns.

4. Error Handling
   - Upload Errors:
     Display of user-friendly messages to the upload of unsupported file formats.

### Non-functional Requirements
1. Performance
   - The calendar naviagtion between the months and task additions should load up between 1-2 seconds.
   - The app has the ability to handle multiple uploads without a delay.
  
2. Responsive Design
   - Ensure the app works smoothly on desktops, tablets and mobile devices.
  
3. Accessibility
   - Ensure screen reader compatibilty and a accessible colour scheme for visually impaired users
  
4. Security
   - Prevent the upload of malicious scripts by santising the user inputs.

## User Stories
User stories are ways of defining the features of the app from the perspective of the end-user. As they help to make the development user-centered, I made a few user stories based on the interaction with stakeholders. They are as below:
1. **Uploading Timetable:**

   As a student,

   I want to upload my timetable on the app

   So that I can track and visualise all my deadlines.

3. **Viewing tasks on calendar:**
   
   As a student,

   I want to view all my deadlines and tasks on a calendar

   So that my schedule can be managed more effectively.

5. **Adding new tasks**:
   
   As a student,

   I want to be able to add new tasks to the calendar

   So that my schedule can be updated without re-uploading the whole timetable.

## Risks
To access the potential risks that may come up in the process, I made the risk matrix below that allows me to make a list of all potential risks and think of strategies to mitigate them.
